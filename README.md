Panel Meter for Power Lab Supplies

**Action Shot**

I use the UltiDMM for my 0-350V 0-100mA lab power supply.
[Calibration] and [oversampling] of the AVR's Analog-to-digital converter plus filtering results in a quite accuracte and very smooth meter. It is quite configurable using an encoder to navigate a simple menu structure. You can change comma-position, Unit, scale, and calibrate the meter at runtime.
